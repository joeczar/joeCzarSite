### Hello, World!

Who would have thought that a global pandemic could lead to so much productivity? I've been thinking about getting a little blog up and running to document my learning and projects for a while. Now, I finally decided to do it. One of the things that had held me back was, I wanted to have a cms system I could learn and tweak and grow as I saw fit. I have a couple of years worth of experience with Wordpresss, and I hated every minute of it. I don't know why, but I just don't like PHP, the plug-ins were always causing problems, and I felt it was just more work than it needed to be. 

Anyway, over the last year I've been teaching myself a lot of JavaScript and a little React. I'd heard about Next.js and thouht I'd give that a try. For some reason, i couldn't get it's server to fire up. So I deleted it and downloaded Gatsby.

After I installed it I was happy to see a happy little react site all built up and ready to go. I's been about 9 months since I last did anything with React, but it didn't take long for me to get everything up and going. Because I've been thinking about this blog project for so long, I didn't want to wait and build up a CMS system. So I googled "Gatsby Blog" and found this tutorial: [Start a blog with Gatsby and Netlify](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/) and it got me up and going.

So, now that the technical stuff is out of the way, I guess the next post should be about how I got here and where I'm going.
